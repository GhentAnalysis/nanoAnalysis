# Testing

This folder contains scripts to test the implemented functionality and do debugging in case weird behaviour is observed. The testing scripts are grouped in subdirectories as follows:
- basic: basic file reading, access to data members, raw selections.
- objectselection: test implementation of lepton and jet IDs and cleaning.
- topleptonmva: test implementation of TOP lepton MVA on the fly.
- others to add...
